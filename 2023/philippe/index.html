                DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK<br>
                ----------------------<br>
                At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
                located near latitude 29.9 North, longitude 64.9 West. Philippe 
                is moving toward the north-northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h). A 
                general northward motion with a further increase in forward speed is
                expected through Saturday night. A turn toward the north-northwest
                is forecast by early Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of
                Philippe will pass near Bermuda later today, and then reach the
                coast of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or eastern Maine Saturday night
                into Sunday.<br><br>
                 
                Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
                gusts. Some strengthening is possible over the next day or so, but
                Philippe is expected to become post-tropical on Saturday.<br><br>
                 
                Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
                from the center. An elevated surface observing station at the 
                National Museum of Bermuda recently reported a sustained wind of
                46 mph (74 km/h) and a gust to 57 mph (91 km/h).<br><br>
                 
                The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).<br><br><br>
                 
                 
                HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND<br>
                ----------------------<br>
                Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone<br>
                Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC<br>
                and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml<br><br>
                 
                WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda today.<br><br>
                 
                RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches expected across Bermuda
                through today. This rainfall could result in flash flooding.<br><br>
                 
                For portions of New York and New England, rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
                inches, with local amounts of 5 inches, are expected with Philippe
                as it moves through the region this weekend.  Isolated to scattered
                instances of urban and flash flooding are expected.<br><br>
                 
                For portions of Southeast Canada, rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches,
                with local amounts of 5 inches, are expected with Philippe as it
                moves through the region this weekend.  Isolated to scattered
                instances of urban and flash flooding are expected.<br><br>
                 
                SURF:  Large swells from Philippe and another weather system will 
                continue to affect Bermuda for the next several days.  Swells are 
                also reaching portions of the southeastern U.S. coast and will 
                spread northward along the east coast to Atlantic Canada during the 
                next couple of days.  These conditions are likely to cause 
                life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult products 
                from your local weather office.<br><br><br>
